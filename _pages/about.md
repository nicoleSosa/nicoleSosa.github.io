Hi! I'm Nicole, and I'm currently a senior at NYU CAS, pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. However, my college adventure began at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I initially studied Biomolecular Science and Chemical Engineering. Life has a funny way of leading us to unexpected paths, and that's exactly what happened to me!

As I explored diverse experiences and coursework during college, I discovered my true passion lies in understanding human behavior and harnessing technology for positive social impact. I genuinely believe that technology can be a force for good, transforming lives and making a difference in society. 

Since then, I've ventured into different domains, including web development, design, data science, software engineering, and user experience. Each exploration provided valuable insights and honed my skills. It was during these diverse experiences that I found myself leaning towards software engineering and data analysis fields. Currently, I am seeking a full-time software engineer or data analyst job. 

This website serves as a platform to showcase the various projects I've worked on, my contributions to open-source, and tech insights I'll be sharing through my blog posts. Thank you for visiting my website and being part of my journey in tech. Let's create a better future through technology together!
