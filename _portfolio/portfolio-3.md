## About:

Book Haven is a platform that offers users a way to explore, track, and organize their reading interests. Whether you're an avid reader or simply looking for your next literary adventure, our application provides a convenient destination for managing your reading list and uncovering captivating reads. 

## Why:

As an avid user and enthusiast of Notion, I could have easily created a new page within that platform. However, I recognized the need for a distinct and dedicated space, separate from my work organization, where I could freely immerse myself in the world of books without any distractions. This led me to create a one-stop place where I can build a curated reading list, keeping track of titles I intend to explore.
