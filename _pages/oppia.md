Oppia is a free and open-source online learning platform dedicated to providing quality education worldwide. Its interactive and conversational approach to learning, with instant feedback, creates a personalized tutoring experience for every learner. I had the privilege of collaborating with my talented team ([Rufaida Khan](https://github.com/ruf99), [Leah Durrett](https://github.com/howtofly-lab), and [Seoeun Hong](https://github.com/seoeunHong))), where we tackled various aspects of Oppia to ensure a great experience for users.

Together, we made over 10 contributions, which included tackling UX issues to enhance user-friendliness, fixing bugs to improve functionality, and updating documentation to provide clear guidance for users. Our collective efforts were driven by the goal of empowering learners and making Oppia an exceptional platform for education.
