## About:

Our big data project is dedicated to investigating the potential correlation between children's elevated blood lead levels and their living conditions in NYC. We delve into whether children from lower-income backgrounds are more susceptible to elevated blood lead levels when residing in specific housing environments. By analyzing data on both blood lead levels and housing conditions, our aim is to provide insights into the impact of living conditions on children's health and development.

## Why?

Our motivation for undertaking this project arises from our collective concern for children's well-being. Lead exposure from sources like old paint, water pipelines, and lead dust can result in serious health consequences, including delayed growth and developmental impairments, damage to the brain and nervous system, and other critical health effects. Our project goes further by examining the potential economic factor. We seek to understand the intersection between housing conditions and socioeconomic status and whether this contributes to elevated blood lead levels among children from lower-income households. Through our efforts, we aspire to raise awareness about the significance of safe and healthy housing for all children.
