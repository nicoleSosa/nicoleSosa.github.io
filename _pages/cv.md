Oppia 
======
Oppia is a free and open-source online learning platform that aims to improve access to quality education worldwide for everyone. Allows users to create and share interactive educational content and uses a conversational approach to learning. This approach provides learners immediate feedback, making the learning experience more engaging and effective. I was fortunate to have contributed to this project with my following team members Rufaida Khan, Seoeun Hong, and Leah Durrettt. 

We were able to help Oppia improve their user experience as well as their inclusivitry through out bug request, bug fixes, and communicatingn with the ciommunityt. oNEO
