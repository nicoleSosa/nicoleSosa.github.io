## About: 

Drinking Buddies provides a one-stop place for users starting their alcohol journey to learn about various aspects of alcohol consumption, from discovering their personal drink preferences to gaining awareness about responsible drinking practices. On this website, users can discover their personal drink preferences through an engaging quiz, explore a variety of beverages neatly categorized by alcohol type, and effortlessly monitor their alcohol consumption with our Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) calculator. In addition, users can access our Help Center for vital alcohol safety information, find convenient cab services, and get quick answers to your queries in our FAQ section. 

## Why?

I've witnessed friends and family embark on their alcohol journeys without the proper guidance, and I saw a need for a supportive platform that combines discovery and responsibility. This project is my commitment to providing a safe and enjoyable space for users to uncover their preferences, make informed choices, and embrace responsible drinking habits. It's about fostering a sense of community, sharing knowledge, and ensuring that everyone can raise their glasses with confidence, knowing they're equipped with the right information.
